# Rust introductory workshop

This workshop will give an introduction to Rust through the slides and some hands-on exercices. Slides for the workshop: https://arild.github.io/rust-workshop

## Preparations

The following steps should be completed before the workshop:
1. Install Rust
    - Linux/Mac: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
    - Windows 10: https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html#other-ways-to-install-rustup
2. Clone project: `git clone https://github.com/arild/rust-workshop.git`
3. Run `cargo test` in project root folder. Code should compile and it's **expected that tests fail** (coding exercises will make them green)
4. Import project to IDE. Verify that code completion is available.
